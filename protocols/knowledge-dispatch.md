## Key Insight: The Architect Is the Knowledge Hub

The Architect touches 8 of 10 domains. This confirms why the Architect agent needs deep client-skill access (`align`, `refine`, `build-plan` review) — every design decision passes through architectural judgment.

But the **CTO filters through maturity stage**. The Architect might say "we need sharding." The CTO says "we have 14 orgs — we need sharding in 2 years, not now."
