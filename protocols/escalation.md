## Agent Behavior While Waiting

1. Post approval request
2. Mark task as "waiting-human" in context.md
3. Continue with other queued work
4. `/loop` heartbeat checks approval-queue every 10min
5. When approved → resume blocked task
6. Agents are NEVER idle waiting — always pick up next available work
